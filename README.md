# WMan

A simple warehouse management software
</div>

## Motivation
WMan (WarehouseMan) first came into my mind when I was helping my father's business at a summer academic break.
I was tired of handling everything manually with GUI software like MS Excel. So, here is
what I came up as an effort to automize some mundane aspects of warehouse management.

## Goals
- Streamline some repeated processes in warehouse management
- Minimize human error
